# COGS-185-Final-Project
This is the repository for Rebecca Du's COGS 185 Final Project. 

- The notebooks and weights for each of the 3 methods can be found in their respective folders. 
- The naming convention is the following: 
  - (window size, training split, testing split)
  - So a notebook named 'COGS 185 Final Project SVM (2, 4k, 1k)' would have the code for the Structured SVM implementation that has a window size of 2, and a 4,000/1,000 training/testing split.
